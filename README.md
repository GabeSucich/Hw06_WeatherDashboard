# Hw06_WeatherDashboard

The end goal of this assignment was to produce a weather dashboard that utilized the OpenWeather API to display information about current and upcoming weather in differenct cities. Upon entering a city name in the search bar, a user would be given the current date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index in that city. Additionally, a five day forecast for temperature, humidity, and general conditions was displayed below. After a user searched a city, that city was to persist in a search history bar upon closing and reopening the application.

This project foremost an introduction to the integration of APIs into website development. It's utilization of local storage, dynamic HTML updating using jQuery, and the boostrap CSS framework synthesized almost all of the material covered in class to date.
